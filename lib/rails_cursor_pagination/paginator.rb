module RailsCursorPagination
  # Use this Paginator class to effortlessly paginate through ActiveRecord
  # relations using cursor pagination. For more details on how this works,
  # read the top-level documentation of the `RailsCursorPagination` module.
  #
  # Usage:
  #     RailsCursorPagination::Paginator
  #       .new(relation, order_by: :author, first: 2, after: "WyJKYW5lIiw0XQ==")
  #       .fetch
  #
  class Paginator
    # Create a new instance of the `RailsCursorPagination::Paginator`
    #
    # @param relation [ActiveRecord::Relation]
    #   Relation that will be paginated.
    # @param limit [Integer, nil]
    #   Number of records to return in pagination. Can be combined with either
    #   `after` or `before` as an alternative to `first` or `last`.
    # @param first [Integer, nil]
    #   Number of records to return in a forward pagination. Can be combined
    #   with `after`.
    # @param after [String, nil]
    #   Cursor to paginate forward from. Can be combined with `first`.
    # @param last [Integer, nil]
    #   Number of records to return. Must be used together with `before`.
    # @param before [String, nil]
    #   Cursor to paginate upto (excluding). Can be combined with `last`.
    # @param order_by [Symbol, String, nil]
    #   Column to order by. If none is provided, will default to ID column.
    #   NOTE: this will cause the query to filter on both the given column as
    #   well as the ID column. So you might want to add a compound index to your
    #   database similar to:
    #   ```sql
    #     CREATE INDEX <index_name> ON <table_name> (<order_by_field>, id)
    #   ```
    # @param order [Symbol, nil]
    #   Ordering to apply, either `:asc` or `:desc`. Defaults to `:asc`.

    #   If any parameter is not valid
